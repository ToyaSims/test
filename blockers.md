 I have sometimes struggled with confidence. I sometimes feel unqualified to speak up at an important meeting, even when my idea could help the team to achieve a goal. I feel this could hinder my growth in the long run, since my employers wont be able to see how much potential I have. I have been trying to better myself by taking note  of the impact I have made on recruits and at the organization to better understand why I should be confident about the skills and unique talents I bring to the table.
